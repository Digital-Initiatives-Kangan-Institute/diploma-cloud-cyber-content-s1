NOTES = {

    "From diagnosis to evidence": """
        Frame this as the map for the whole Topic — you're bridging from Topic 2 (the diagnosis) to the
        evidence a decision rests on. Set the shape, don't teach content yet.
        • The hinge line: a board doesn't fund a PROBLEM — it funds a well-evidenced ANSWER. Topic 2 proved
          the problem; today builds the answer.
        • Preview the three moves — lay out the OPTIONS → COST them over time → weigh the RISKS. Each maps to
          a section today and each becomes the next section of the same business case.
        • Stress the edge (the accent line): you still DON'T recommend today. You assemble the evidence a
          recommendation will rest on — the call itself is Topic 4.
        • Where this fits: they're still MTS consultants advising YAT; this is the analytical core of the
          business case they've been building on Ledgerline all along.
        Misconception to pre-empt: "the evidence IS the recommendation." No — comparing and costing options
        is not the same as choosing one; keep them from jumping to "move to cloud" before the evidence is in.
        Question to pose: "You've proved Ledgerline's on-prem setup is a problem — why isn't that enough to
        get a board to write a cheque?" (they fund an evidenced answer, not a problem).

    """,

    "You don't recommend until you've compared": """
        Open Section 1 — the discipline of comparison before choice. Short, high-leverage framing slide.
        • The core idea: a single proposal isn't a case, it's an assertion. Credible advice compares
          realistic options on a LEVEL FIELD — same yardstick, same horizon.
        • The accent line is the job description for this section: lay the options out and EVALUATE them —
          not pick one. Picking is later.
        • Make it consultant-real: a client can smell a foregone conclusion; showing you weighed the
          alternatives is what makes the eventual recommendation trustworthy.
        Misconception to pre-empt: that presenting one well-argued option is thorough. It isn't — without a
        compared alternative there's no evidence the chosen path is better, only that it's advocated.
        Question to pose: "If a consultant handed you one option and said 'do this', what would you, as the
        client, immediately want to know?" (what else was considered, and why not that).
        UoC/AT1 tie: KE 3 (methods of evaluating competing/complementary systems); this is AT1 §6's premise.
    """,

    "Define the workload first": """
        Teach this as the anchor of the whole section — you can't compare options until you've stated what
        any option must satisfy. Give it weight.
        • Walk it: before comparing, write down the workload/requirements — pulled from their Topic 2 gap
          analysis plus the migration requirements: capacity & peaks, availability target, recovery
          (RPO/RTO), data residency & retention, integrations.
        • The accent line: write it down FIRST — it's the yardstick every option is measured against. Without
          it, "better" has no meaning.
        • Make RPO/RTO concrete for an accounting system: how much data could Ledgerline afford to lose, and
          how long could it be down, before the business hurts?
        Misconception to pre-empt: that requirements are obvious and can stay in your head. No — an unwritten
        requirement is one an option can silently fail; the written list is what keeps the comparison honest.
        Question to pose: "What must ANY Ledgerline solution do, regardless of whether it's on-prem or cloud?"
        (surfaces the shared yardstick before options enter).

    """,

    "Identify the realistic options": """
        Teach option-framing — the set must be honest and small, and must include the status quo.
        • Walk the set: Option A = renew / stay on-prem (the status-quo baseline); Option B = migrate to the
          cloud. Name a third only if it's genuinely real (don't invent a straw man to knock down).
        • The accent line does the heavy lifting: every comparison NEEDS the status-quo option — or "moving"
          has nothing to beat. Doing nothing is always a real option.
        • Tie to YAT: Option A isn't "do nothing" — it's actively renewing the on-prem server (real capex);
          that's what makes it a fair contender, not a punching bag.
        Misconception to pre-empt: that more options = more thorough. No — a bloated option set dilutes the
        analysis; two well-chosen, genuinely-considered options beat five token ones.
        Question to pose: "Why must 'keep Ledgerline on-prem' be one of the options, even in a report that's
        probably heading toward cloud?" (a comparison needs a baseline; it keeps the case credible).
        UoC/AT1 tie: KE 3 → AT1 §6.2 (options considered).
    """,

    "Choosing an evaluation method": """
        Teach the evaluation lenses — this is where "gut feel" becomes a defensible method.
        • Two stated lenses: IMPACT against the strategic objectives (does it move the org toward its goals?)
          and DIFFICULTY of implementing (effort, disruption, skills, dependencies).
        • The method: score each option on each lens and SHOW the reasoning — a score with no rationale is
          just an opinion with a number on it. Cost is deliberately held back to Section 2.
        • Tie to YAT: impact = does moving Ledgerline serve YAT's actual objectives; difficulty = a small RTO
          with thin cloud skills faces a real learning curve — that's a legitimate difficulty score.
        Misconception to pre-empt: that "evaluation method" means a formula that spits out the answer. No —
        it's a stated, consistent basis for judgement; the value is transparency, not automation.
        Question to pose: "Two options both look good — what two questions let you rank them without
        mentioning money yet?" (how much does each move the objectives; how hard is each to do).
        UoC/AT1 tie: PC 2.1 (evaluate impact vs strategic objectives) + PC 2.2/PE 5 (evaluate difficulty) → §6.3.
    """,

    "Impact & difficulty — a first read": """
        Short synthesis slide — the qualitative shortlist before the numbers arrive. Lean on the matrix idea.
        • A simple matrix communicates it: each option plotted on {impact, difficulty}. High impact + low
          difficulty = a strong candidate; high impact + high difficulty = real, but plan for it.
        • The accent line: this is the QUALITATIVE shortlist — the CBA (Section 2) and the risk section
          (Section 3) test it next. It's a first read, not a verdict.
        • Keep it honest: a high-difficulty option isn't disqualified — it's flagged for planning; that
          nuance is what a mature consultant brings.
        Misconception to pre-empt: that the matrix decides. It doesn't — it organises the qualitative read so
        the cost and risk work can confirm or overturn it; a cheap-looking option can still lose on risk.
        Question to pose: "Where does 'migrate Ledgerline to cloud' land on impact vs difficulty for YAT —
        and does landing in 'high difficulty' kill it?" (no — it means plan for it).

        section for the Accounting System (Ledgerline). Evaluate the options — do NOT decide yet."
        Steps (put on the board):
        1. State the workload/requirements an option must satisfy (from your gap table + migration reqs).
        2. Lay out Option A (renew on-prem) and Option B (migrate to cloud).

    "Put a number on it": """
        Open Section 2 — the CBA turns a feeling into evidence. Set the frame before the mechanics.
        • The core: a CBA compares the options in MONEY, over TIME — here, a 5-year horizon. It turns "cloud
          feels cheaper" into evidence, or disproves it (sometimes cloud isn't cheaper — that's a valid finding).
        • The accent line: a board decides on TOTAL cost + benefit over the horizon, not a monthly price. A
          monthly figure alone hides the upfront and the long tail.
        • Callback to Topic 1 §5: this is where the cost-model theory (compute/storage/data-transfer, reserved
          vs on-demand) gets APPLIED to real numbers — you're not re-teaching it, you're using it.
        Misconception to pre-empt: "the cheapest monthly bill wins." No — the horizon and upfront commitments
        can reverse a monthly-only read; the 5-year total is the honest comparison.
        Question to pose: "Why compare Ledgerline's options over 5 years instead of just this month's bill?"

    "What a good CBA contains": """
        Teach the anatomy of the CBA so their AT1 §7 has the right parts. Lean on the structure.

          comparison summary → sensitivity check. Compare like-for-like over the same horizon.
        • The accent line: state EVERY assumption — an unstated assumption is a hole in the case. Hours,
          instance size, region, licence terms, growth — name them or the numbers can't be trusted.
        • Where things live: detailed line items go in Appendix 1; the §7 section shows only the summary. Keep
          the body readable; put the arithmetic in the appendix.
        Misconception to pre-empt: that a CBA is just a table of prices. No — it's assumptions + costs +
        benefits + a stress-test; the assumptions and the sensitivity are what make it credible, not the table.
        Question to pose: "If I challenged one number in your Ledgerline CBA, what would let you defend it?"

    "Costing the on-prem option (Option A)": """
        Teach how to cost the status-quo option fairly — students under-cost on-prem because it's "already there".
        • Walk it: Option A = renew / keep on-prem. Cost it from the operational-costing facts — capex (server
          refresh) + opex (power, maintenance, licences, admin time), over the full 5 years.
        • The accent line — the trap: software LICENSING (Windows / SQL Server) rides on BOTH options; don't
          drop it from A or you flatter the on-prem number and skew the comparison.
        • Push completeness: admin time and a mid-life hardware refresh are real on-prem costs students forget;
          a fair Option A includes the boring, ongoing money.
        Misconception to pre-empt: "on-prem is basically free because we own it." No — owned kit still costs
        power, maintenance, licences, admin and eventual refresh; ignoring those rigs the CBA toward on-prem.
        Question to pose: "What on-prem costs would YAT keep paying even though the server is already bought?"

          solution before building it; find instance types & contract terms; group services into an estimate.
        • Frame it as the consultant's estimating instrument — this is literally how they'll size Option B for
          the CBA. It sizes the cloud option; it does NOT assemble the comparison (that's the next slide).

          BENEFIT (value the reliability gain, don't just assert it); and a sensitivity check.

          assumptions that, if wrong, would flip the answer — that's intellectual honesty, and it's markable.
        • Make avoided-downtime concrete: if on-prem Ledgerline goes down X hours/year and cloud cuts that,
