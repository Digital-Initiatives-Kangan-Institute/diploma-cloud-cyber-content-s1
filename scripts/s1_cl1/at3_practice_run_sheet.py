"""The S1-CL1 AT3 PRACTICE HA run sheet — content.

Same shape as the AT3 assessment workbook, different everything else. A student who works
through this has rehearsed every move the assessment needs without having seen its answers:

  scenario   Ledgerline, YAT's accounting system — not the LMS
  addresses  10.20.x.x — not 10.0.x.x
  servers    Amazon Linux — not Windows
  database   PostgreSQL on 5432 — not MySQL on 3306
  monitoring one baseline alarm — not two

The starting point is `delivery/practice-lab-pack/baseline.yaml`, which replicates a correctly
completed AT2 PRACTICE build. It carries the same four single points of failure the assessment
environment does, by construction: only the first zone carries load, one NAT gateway, an Auto
Scaling group of one in one subnet, and a single-AZ database. The load balancer already spans
both public subnets — so practice task 9's "look before you design" trap rehearses too.

WHAT PRACTICE ADDS, and the whole reason it exists:

  Part A   every design task is presented exactly as the assessment presents it, then adds a
           "Things to consider" block — leading questions, pointed enough that a student who
           is paying attention cannot miss the answer, and which never state it. Practice
           teaches the thinking; it does not hand over the finding, because then the student
           arrives at the assessment having watched rather than done.
  Part B   click-by-click steps. The assessment says "extend the Auto Scaling group across
           both zones"; practice says which console, which tab, which button.

No marking criteria, no UoC tags, no institutional boilerplate — it is not an assessment.
Rendered by the shared renderer in at3_run_sheet, with these lists passed in.

SCENARIO = [
    "Ledgerline is YAT College's accounting system. It moved to AWS in the previous practice "
    "exercise — you built the foundation yourself, or you have been given it ready-made. Finance "
    "staff use it every day, and month-end is unforgiving.",
    "It works, and it is fragile. Everything that serves Ledgerline sits in one availability zone, "
    "there is one application server, and the database has no standby. Finance have asked what "
    "happens if something breaks, and nobody has a good answer.",
    "This is practice. Nothing here is assessed and nothing is submitted. It is the same work the "
    "assessment will ask for, on a different system — so do it properly, because the moves are the "
    "point.",

INSTRUCTIONS = [
    "Part A is the design. Work the tasks in order. Each one is presented the way the assessment "
    "presents it, and then adds a Things to consider block underneath.",
    "Those considerations are leading questions, not answers. If you work through them honestly you "
    "will arrive at the answer yourself — which is the only version of it that will still be there "
    "in the assessment.",
    "Part B is the build, and unlike the assessment it tells you exactly where to click. Use that "
    "now. In the assessment you will be told what to build and left to find your own way around the "
    "console, so pay attention to where things live.",
    "Everything you design in Part A, you build in Part B. That is how the assessment works too.",
