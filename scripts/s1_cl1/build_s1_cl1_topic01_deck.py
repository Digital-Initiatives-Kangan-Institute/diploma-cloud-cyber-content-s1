"""Topic 1 (Intro to Cloud) — authored into Kangan-branded layouts, like the Topic 2 build.

Topic 1 mixes bespoke text with AWS slides carrying images/diagrams. Rather than re-skin the
old deck (which mis-sized text and dropped rasters), this AUTHORS Topic 1 fresh into the clean
Kangan layouts and drops a labelled PLACEHOLDER box wherever a visual belongs — raster image or
native vector diagram alike. Images are transferred in manually afterwards.

Content faithful to Topic_01_Slides.pptx (titles, bullets, tables, section structure).
Brand: documentaion/kangan-branding.md. Reuses helpers from build_kangan_topic_deck.

Usage:  python scripts/build_kangan_topic1_deck.py [output.pptx]
