"""S1-CL1 Assessment Mapping docs — THIN WRAPPER (cluster data + delegation only).

================================================================================
⚠  NOT the canonical generator. The docx-building mechanics live in the shared engine
   ┖─ scripts/mapping/generate_mapping_doc.py  ← the single generator for ALL clusters.
   CL1 is the LEGACY cluster: it has no invertible assessor benchmark, so the engine drives it from
   the hand-authored DATA_* dicts below (CLUSTERS "cl1", source:"data"). This module now keeps only
   that data + UNIT_DATA — which the validate-mapping-doc skill reads as CL1's oracle; the
   docx-building mechanics (formerly an in-place edit of a pre-populated docx) are the engine's.
   • To (re)generate:   python scripts/mapping/generate_mapping_doc.py --build cl1
   • Contract + pipeline + CL1 conformance status: docs/mapping-document-standard.md
   Full conformance (real machine-readable, UoC-tagged benchmarks in CL1's assessors) is a separate
   retrofit; the CL2/CL3 engine entries are the worked examples of the intended implementation.
================================================================================

DATA_401/502/517 map each PC/PE/KE/FS/AC item to its AT1/AT2/AT3 criterion code(s). Reflects the
2026-05-25 502 PC reassignment (PCs 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 moved AT3 → AT2) and the AT3 v1.0 simplified
shape (no closure pack; no SRM; HA Deployment Report carries PCs 5.1, 5.2, 5.3).
