"""The S1-CL1 AT2 PRACTICE build run sheet — content.

Same shape as the assessment run sheet, different everything else. A student who works
through this has rehearsed every skill the assessment needs without having seen its answers:

  scenario   Ledgerline, YAT's accounting system — not the LMS
  addresses  10.20.x.x — not 10.0.x.x
  servers    Amazon Linux — not Windows
  database   PostgreSQL on 5432 — not MySQL on 3306
  detail     every task carries click-by-click steps. The assessment deliberately does not.

This is a practice exercise, not an assessment: no marking criteria, no UoC tags, no
institutional boilerplate. Rendered by the shared renderer in at2_run_sheet.
