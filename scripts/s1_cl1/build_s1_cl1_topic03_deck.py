"""Topic 3 (Building the evidence) — authored into Kangan-branded layouts.

Built from topic_03/slide_plan.md + coverage.md. Mostly bespoke (options / CBA / risk), with the
two AWS Pricing Calculator slides (ACF M02 S20 + S22, supplied in source_slides/) authored in at
their marked positions in C2 — the calculator screenshot left as a labelled placeholder to transfer.

Brand: documentaion/kangan-branding.md. Reuses helpers from build_kangan_topic_deck (brand
primitives + layouts) and build_kangan_topic1_deck (visual_slide + placeholder).

Usage:  python scripts/build_kangan_topic3_deck.py [output.pptx]
