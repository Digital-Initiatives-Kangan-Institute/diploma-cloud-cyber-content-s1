"""The S1-CL1 AT2 build run sheet — content, and the renderer that puts it in a document.

ONE definition of the run sheet, rendered two ways:

  student   the blank sheet the student works through and fills in — the job, the settings,
            empty screenshot boxes, empty response boxes. No UoC tags.
  assessor  the worked copy: every screenshot box replaced by a terracotta description of
            what should be in it, every response box filled with a teal model answer, and
            each task tagged with the UoC items it evidences.

Source of truth for the task list, its settings and its coverage:
  S1-CL1-Cloud-Design-Build/assessments/AT2/at2-build-tasks.md

Every value specified here is one the lab environment will accept. Sizes are the smallest
that do the job — the previous design named m6i.large / db.m6i.large, which students could
not launch.
