"""The S1-CL2 AT1 Part C approval workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine.

WHAT THIS PART IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. Part C is a live event: the student walks Sam Walker
(role-played by the assessor) through the Part A design and the Part B plan, answers questions,
responds to feedback, lodges the plan and obtains sign-off. `[ICTCLD501 PC 5.1]` says "Conduct
VERBAL walkthrough" and `[ICTCLD501 FS Oral communication]` is only demonstrable in the room.
**Completing this worksheet is not the assessment — presenting is.** The front matter says so
to the student, in those words.

WHY THERE IS NO PRESENTATION DECK. PC 5.1 requires a verbal walkthrough of the plan, not a
slide deck. A deck is a delivery convention, not a unit requirement, so under the standing rule
(worksheet unless a UoC requirement explicitly demands a separate artefact) none is asked for.
The student walks through the two documents they have already produced. A student who wants to
build slides may, and nothing marks them.

THE TWO KINDS OF ELEMENT HERE. Preparation tasks carry no `uoc` and no `standard` — they are
scaffolding, they are not marking criteria, and their prompts say so, so neither student nor
assessor mistakes them for assessed work. The record tasks that follow ARE the criteria, one
per PC in element 5.
