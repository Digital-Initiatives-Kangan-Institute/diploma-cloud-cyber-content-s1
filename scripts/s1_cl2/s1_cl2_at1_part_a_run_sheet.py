"""The S1-CL2 AT1 Part A design workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine in
the umbrella (`helpers/run_sheet.py`). Same form as S1-CL1 AT3 Part A: the workbook supplies
the environment and the ORDER of the tasks; every finding and every design decision is the
student's.

WHY THERE IS NO SOLUTION DESIGN TEMPLATE. ICTCLD503's assessment conditions (AC 1–9) are all
environment and input conditions — a cloud vendor, a managed database service, a serverless
environment, an IDE, a browser, data sources. None names a document format or a reporting
standard. So `[ICTCLD503 PC 1.7]` "Document and justify architecture changes" and
`[ICTCLD503 PC 2.4]` "Document and justify architecture design" are satisfied by this
worksheet: the tasks are the documenting, and tasks 14 and 19 are the justifying. Contrast
`[ICTCLD501 AC 3]` — "reporting standards for documenting and communicating disaster recovery
plan" — which is why AT1 Part B keeps a real DR Plan document.

THE MARKING MODEL. Values in this document are ours, invented so the student has a concrete
task; the unit's wording is vague by design. Each element carries the `uoc` items it evidences
and a `standard` naming what must be true for them to be met. An assessor marks the standard,
never the table. A student who puts the edge cache in front of the whole site where we put it
in front of static content only has still met `[ICTCLD503 PC 1.5]`; one who leaves the India
audience served from Sydney over the open internet has not — not because it differs from ours,
but because it does not answer the latency requirement they recorded in task 1.

THE TWO STRANDS mirror the unit's own elements: tasks 1–14 are element 1 (web-scale design,
PC 1.1–1.7), tasks 15–19 are element 2 (microservice design, PC 2.1–2.4). Each strand closes
with its own justification task, because that is where its final PC sits.

STARTING STATE. The website arrives HA-hardened — Multi-AZ, single-region, in ap-southeast-2.
That is the end state of the CL1 work and it is supplied, not designed. This assessment adds
global serving and the India-resident audit-log microservice on top of it. Cross-region
disaster recovery is Part B's DR plan, not this part.
