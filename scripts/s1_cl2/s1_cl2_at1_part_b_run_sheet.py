"""The S1-CL2 AT1 Part B disaster-recovery workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine in
the umbrella (`helpers/run_sheet.py`). Same form as Part A.

WHY THIS PART KEEPS A TEMPLATE, WHEN PART A DOES NOT. `[ICTCLD501 AC 3]` is explicit —
"reporting standards for documenting and communicating disaster recovery plan" — and
`[ICTCLD501 PE 3]` requires the student to "document disaster recovery plan". A DR plan is an
artefact YAT keeps and uses; it is lodged as a record and read by someone in an incident. So
the plan survives as a real document. What the worksheet takes over is the THINKING: the
student works every analysis and decision here, task by task, and the closing task copies the
answers into the YAT Disaster Recovery Plan template. Both are submitted.

THE TASK ORDER IS THE TEMPLATE'S SECTION ORDER. That is deliberate and it is what makes the
copy-out mechanical rather than a translation job at the end. Task N maps to one template
section; the closing task carries the map. If the template's sections are ever re-ordered,
re-order these tasks with them.

WHAT THIS PART IS RECOVERING. The system designed in Part A — the globally-served website with
its India audit-log service. A DR plan is written for a designed system, which is why Part A
comes first. Several tasks copy forward from Part A the way AT3's Part B copies forward from
its Part A.

THE MARKING MODEL. Values here are ours, invented so the student has a concrete task. Each
element carries the `uoc` items it evidences and a `standard` naming what must be true for them
to be met. An assessor marks the standard, never the table. A student whose recovery strategy
is warm standby where we modelled pilot light has still met `[ICTCLD501 PC 3.1]` if the choice
is argued against their own RTO; one who names a strategy that cannot reach the RTO they set
has not.
