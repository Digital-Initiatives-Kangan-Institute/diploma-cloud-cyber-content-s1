"""The S1-CL2 AT2 microservice-and-IaC build workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine in
the umbrella (`helpers/run_sheet.py`).

WHY THERE IS NO DEPLOYMENT REPORT TEMPLATE. ICTCLD505's assessment conditions (AC 1–9) are all
environment conditions — a vendor, an infrastructure-as-code service, an IDE, a browser, an
SSH/RDP client, console/CLI tooling. Like ICTCLD503's, none names a document format or a
reporting standard, and there is no equivalent of `[ICTCLD501 AC 3]` anywhere in this unit. So
`[ICTCLD505 PC 4.1]` "Create user documentation including cloud infrastructure as code
templates" and `[ICTCLD505 PE 4]` are met by task 20 of this worksheet, which asks for real
user documentation with a real audience — whoever operates this stack after the student leaves.
The worksheet is the deliverable.

WHAT IS PROVIDED AND WHAT IS AUTHORED — the seam this whole AT turns on:

  provided   the data-store template (`datastore.yaml`). The student OPERATES it: reads it,
             deploys it, fixes it when it fails, updates it, and eventually removes it. This is
             ICTCLD505 element 2, which is explicitly about PRE-DEFINED templates.
  provided   the microservice application code (`handler.py`) and the webhook contract. The
             student does not write application code — ICTCLD503 element 3 is about deploying
             and configuring, not developing.
  authored   the student's OWN template that provisions the API, the queue, the function and
             the permissions, and wires them to the provided data store. This is ICTCLD505
             element 3 and `[ICTCLD505 PE 2]`.

THE PLANTED FAULT. The provided template does not deploy as supplied: its AttributeDefinitions
declares an attribute named `id` while its KeySchema uses `event_id`, so CloudFormation rejects
it. This is deliberate and it is the evidence for `[ICTCLD505 PC 2.6]` and `[ICTCLD505 KE 7]` —
a student who never sees a template fail has never troubleshot one. Task 7 is where they find
it. Do not fix it in the supplied file.

THE MARKING MODEL. Values here are ours, invented so the student has a concrete task. Each
element carries the `uoc` items it evidences and a `standard` naming what must be true for them
to be met. An assessor marks the standard, never the table.

REGION. The design places the audit store in India; the Learner Lab does not offer that region.
The notation `[scenario: ap-south-1 | deploy: us-east-1]` is used throughout per the umbrella's
region-substitution standard — the design stays multi-region, the deploy is single-region.
