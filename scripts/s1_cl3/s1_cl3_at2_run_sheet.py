"""The S1-CL3 AT2 team-implementation workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine in
the umbrella (`helpers/run_sheet.py`).

THE ONE GROUP ASSESSMENT IN S1, AND HOW IT STILL WORKS AS A WORKSHEET. The work is done by a
team; the assessment is of each individual. Every BSBXTW401 performance criterion describes what
ONE PERSON does in relation to the team — allocates, instructs, facilitates, coaches, measures,
gives feedback, manages conflict. So each student gets their own copy of this worksheet and
fills it in from their own seat. The team produces one plan and one integrated template; each
student records that plan in their own sheet and evidences their own leadership around it.

THE WORKSHEET IS THE MEETING AGENDA. Part A's tasks are written to be worked through with the
team in the room — "agree this with your team, then record it below". Four students sitting
around a table with the same worksheet have a planning agenda, which is a better artefact than a
blank team-plan template and produces the same evidence.

WHAT IS NOT IN THE WORKSHEET. The CloudFormation the team writes is real work with a real
output, and it is submitted as itself — a repository, the template files, whatever the team
actually produced. Task 7 captures where it is and what the student's own contribution was; it
does not try to reproduce the work inside a worksheet. The technical write is BSBXTW401's
vehicle, not what BSBXTW401 assesses.

THE OBSERVED MEETING, AND WHY THE RECORDS EXIST TOO. `[BSBXTW401 PC 3.4]` and `[BSBXTW401 PE 5]`
need a challenge or conflict to have actually happened, and `[BSBXTW401 PC 3.1]` needs someone to
have needed coaching. A well-run twenty-minute stand-up where nothing goes wrong gives a student
nowhere to demonstrate any of them. So this workbook routes that evidence twice: the student
keeps running records across the project (tasks 10 to 12), and the observed meeting confirms what
those records claim. A student is then evidenced on what they did over weeks, not on whether
something usefully went wrong while the assessor was watching.

THE ASSESSOR'S SIGNATURE. Task 9 carries a signature block the assessor completes in the room.
The worksheet records that the observation happened; the assessor's own judgement of it is theirs
to record wherever the institution requires. The student's job is to arrange it and capture it.

THE MARKING MODEL. Values here are ours, invented so the student has a concrete task. Each
element carries the `uoc` items it evidences and a `standard` naming what must be true for them
to be met. An assessor marks the standard, never the table.
