"""Build the S1-CL3 AT1 instruments (.docx) — assessor and student — from the Kangan template.

AT1 = Cloud Infrastructure Improvement: Design. ICTCLD504 elements 1–2: analyse the Enrolline
cloud baseline, design a proportionate improvement, present it and obtain sign-off to proceed.

ONE DEFINITION, TWO INSTRUMENTS — content in s1_cl3_at1_run_sheet.py, rendered worked for the assessor
and blank for the student. The marking guide's traceability lines and the reverse map are
derived from the workbook's own tags (helpers.workbook_instrument), and the Kangan wiring is the
shared `assemble`.

NO SOLUTION DESIGN TEMPLATE. ICTCLD504's assessment conditions (AC 1–8) are environment and
input conditions and name no document format, so `[ICTCLD504 PC 2.4]` "document and present" is
met by the worksheet (documenting) plus Part B (presenting).

OVERVIEW = [
    "Students are assessed on analysing the cloud infrastructure of YAT's Enrolline student records "
    "and enrolment management system, designing a proportionate improvement to it, and obtaining sign-off to proceed to "
    "deployment. AT1 is the first of three assessment tasks in the S1-CL3 Cloud Infrastructure "
    "Improvement cluster.",
    "The assessment is one guided workbook of fifteen design tasks, three approval tasks and "
    "three knowledge questions, submitted as a single document. Part A leads the student through "
    "reviewing the current architecture, evaluating its business impact, assessing compliance "
    "against the Indian regulatory requirements, identifying architectural options, setting "
    "measurable business goals and metrics, designing the improvement across the four concerns, "
    "justifying each on cost versus benefit, and drawing the result. Part B is a live session in "
    "which the student presents the proposal and obtains sign-off.",
    "THE IMPROVEMENT IS OPEN — THIS IS THE POINT OF THE CLUSTER. There is no target architecture "
    "and no planted set of faults. The Improvement Requirements are outcomes, and IR-2 asks for "
    "sound engineering proportionate to an internal, business-hours finance system, explicitly "
    "not gold-plating. A student who proposes every improvement available has not done better "
    "than one who proposes four and justifies each — they have done worse. Mark the reasoning, "
    "not the ambition.",
    "WHAT IS BEING MARKED. Every table and worked answer contains values we chose so there is a "
    "concrete task. Each element carries two assessor-only lines: 'Evidences', naming the UoC "
    "items, and 'Satisfactory when', naming what has to be true for them to be met. Mark the "
    "second. Because the improvement is open, most standards here are about whether the student's "
    "reasoning holds, not whether they reached our answer — converting the database to a standby "
    "is defensible on a recovery goal, and so is leaving it single-instance with a tested restore "
    "if the cost is argued.",
    "This is an open-book assessment. Students may use the YAT intranet, AWS documentation, "
    "course materials and external research (which must be cited). They may not use another "
    "student.",
    "Reasonable adjustment may include extending the design time, providing one-on-one verbal "
    "explanation of the supplied environment, allowing the Part B session by video conference, or "
    "splitting the work across more sittings.",
    "Teacher/assessor support level: the assessor may clarify what a task is asking and explain "
    "the supplied records, but must not identify improvements for the student, set their goals or "
    "metrics, or confirm whether a design decision is correct.",
    "The assessment will not proceed if for any reason it is not safe to do so. You must advise "
    "the student of the reason for suspending the assessment, and what safety action should be "
    "taken. Advise the student of revised arrangements when it is safe to do so.",
    "There is a zero tolerance for plagiarism, cheating and collusion. Students will be expected "
    "to make a declaration that all work is their own prior to submission. Refer to the Training "
    "and Assessment Policy for further information.",

    "answer than proposing four you can justify — it is a worse one.",

TASKS = [
    "YAT College's offshore partnership in India has put a spotlight on the systems supporting "
    "it. Enrolline — the finance and office-administration system — was migrated to AWS in an "
    "earlier engagement and has run there since, but it was migrated as-is: the whole workload "
    "sits in one availability zone and nothing has been revisited since cutover.",
    "MTS is engaged to confirm Enrolline is stable, reliable, fit for purpose and compliant with "
    "the Indian regulatory requirements that now apply, and to improve it where it is not. What "
    "that improvement consists of is the student's analysis to make.",
    "Part A — Analysis and design. Fifteen tasks: review the architecture and the decisions it "
    "represents, evaluate the business impact of those decisions, assess compliance against the "
    "Indian Regulatory Requirements, identify the design patterns and options available, assess "
    "their benefits against how this business actually runs, set measurable business goals across "
    "security, reliability, performance and cost, confirm the direction including what is NOT "
    "being proposed, confirm the metrics, design the improvements to compute, storage, database, "
    "network, security, reliability, scalability, cost and monitoring, justify each on cost "
    "versus benefit, draw the result, and write the justification.",
    "Part B — Review and approval. The student presents the proposal to the role-played YAT ICT "
    "Manager, answers questions, and obtains sign-off recording exactly which improvements are "
    "approved — that approved list is AT3's scope. The first task of Part B is the student's own "
    "preparation and is not marked.",
    "MTS scope: cloud infrastructure only. The Enrolline application and its financial data are "
