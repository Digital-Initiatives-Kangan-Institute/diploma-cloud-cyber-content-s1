"""Build the S1-CL3 AT3 instruments (.docx) — assessor and student — from the Kangan template.

AT3 = Cloud Infrastructure Improvement: Implement. ICTCLD504 elements 3–4: deploy the approved
improvement onto the baseline, demonstrate it against the metrics set in AT1, refine it from the
test results, document the as-deployed state and obtain final sign-off.

NO DEPLOYMENT REPORT TEMPLATE. ICTCLD504's assessment conditions name no document format, so
`[ICTCLD504 PC 4.1]` and `[ICTCLD504 PE 5]` are met by tasks 10 and 11 of the worksheet.

OVERVIEW = [
    "Students are assessed on deploying the approved Enrolline improvement, demonstrating it "
    "against the metrics and business goals they set in AT1, refining it from their own test "
    "results, documenting the as-deployed environment and obtaining final sign-off. AT3 is the "
    "third and final assessment task in the S1-CL3 Cloud Infrastructure Improvement cluster.",
    "The assessment is one guided workbook of thirteen tasks and two knowledge questions, "
    "submitted as a single document. The student deploys the assessor-provided baseline, records "
    "the scope their AT1 sign-off actually approved, applies the improvement as an update to the "
    "running environment, measures against their own metrics, demonstrates reliability, security, "
    "scalability and cost optimisation one at a time, applies refinements traced to test results, "
    "documents the as-deployed result and a long-term strategy, obtains sign-off, and tears the "
    "environment down.",
    "EACH STUDENT DEPLOYS THEIR OWN APPROVED SCOPE. AT1 produced each student's own improvement "
    "design and its sign-off, so what is deployed here differs between students. Task 2 records "
    "that scope and is the reference for task 10's 'changes from the approved design'. A student "
    "who deploys something they were not approved to build has not met [ICTCLD504 PC 3.1].",
    "THE TESTS ARE THE ASSESSMENT. [ICTCLD504 PC 3.3] requires the student to test AND DEMONSTRATE "
    "all four concerns. Tasks 5–8 are one per concern and each asks for something to be made to "
    "happen and something observed. 'The design is reliable because it spans two zones' has "
    "demonstrated nothing; terminating an instance and showing the service continuing has.",
    "AN ASSESSOR REFERENCE TEMPLATE IS THE FALLBACK. Where a team's integrated template from AT2 "
    "is not usable, provide the reference improvement template so an individual's evidence here "
    "is not blocked by someone else's work.",
    "WHAT IS BEING MARKED. Each element carries two assessor-only lines: 'Evidences', naming the "
    "UoC items, and 'Satisfactory when', naming what has to be true for them to be met. Mark the "
    "second. Because each student's approved improvement differs, most standards are about "
    "whether the demonstration actually tests the thing that student designed.",
    "This is an open-book practical assessment. Students may use the YAT intranet, AWS "
    "documentation, course materials and external research (which must be cited). They may not "
    "use another student.",
    "Reasonable adjustment may include extending the deployment window, providing one-on-one "
    "verbal explanation of the baseline, allowing alternative evidence formats where assistive "
    "technology requires it, or splitting the work across more sittings.",
    "Teacher/assessor support level: the assessor may clarify what a task is asking and explain "
    "the baseline, but must not diagnose deployment failures for the student, design the tests, "
    "or decide the refinements.",
    "The assessment will not proceed if for any reason it is not safe to do so. You must advise "
    "the student of the reason for suspending the assessment, and what safety action should be "
    "taken. Advise the student of revised arrangements when it is safe to do so.",
    "There is a zero tolerance for plagiarism, cheating and collusion. Students will be expected "
    "to make a declaration that all work is their own prior to submission. Refer to the Training "
    "and Assessment Policy for further information.",

TASKS = [

    "Tasks 1–3 deploy the baseline, record the approved scope, and apply the improvement as an "
    "update to the running environment rather than a rebuild.",
    "Tasks 4–8 measure and demonstrate: the metrics and business goals set in AT1, then "
    "reliability (by inducing a real failure), security (by testing a control rather than listing "
    "it), scalability (by causing a scaling event), and cost optimisation (against the AT1 "
    "estimate, with a cost measure shown working).",
    "Tasks 9–13 close the engagement: refinements traced to specific test results, documentation "
    "of the as-deployed architecture and test results with every difference from the approved "
