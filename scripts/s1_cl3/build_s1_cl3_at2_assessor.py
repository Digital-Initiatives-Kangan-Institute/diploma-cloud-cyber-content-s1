"""Build the S1-CL3 AT2 instruments (.docx) — assessor and student — from the Kangan template.

AT2 = Team Implementation. BSBXTW401 in full: each student is assessed individually on how they
work within, and lead, the team that encodes the approved improvement as infrastructure as code.

THE ONLY GROUP ASSESSMENT IN S1. The work is done by a team; the assessment is of the individual.
Every BSBXTW401 criterion describes what ONE PERSON does in relation to the team, so each student
completes their own copy of the workbook — including where they are recording something the team
agreed together.

WHAT IS NOT IN THE WORKBOOK. The CloudFormation the team writes is submitted as itself. Task 7
records where it lives and what the student contributed; the technical quality is not marked
here, because BSBXTW401 assesses the teamwork and the write is only its vehicle.

]

OVERVIEW = [
    "Students are assessed individually, within a team, on leading and facilitating the team that "
    "implements the approved Enrolline improvement as infrastructure as code. AT2 is the second "
    "of three assessment tasks in the S1-CL3 Cloud Infrastructure Improvement cluster and the "
    "only group assessment in the semester.",
    "The team is four members, each owning one cloud component — network, compute, database or "
    "storage — and together they produce one integrated, deployable template. Each student "
    "completes their own copy of the workbook: the team's plan, their own allocated work, one "
    "team meeting they lead with the assessor observing, written reflections on the conflict, "
    "coaching and issue-resolution they were personally involved in, and a review of the team's "
    "performance against the plan.",
    "THE WORK IS THE TEAM'S; THE ASSESSMENT IS THE INDIVIDUAL'S. Every criterion below describes "
    "what one person did. Four students will submit four different workbooks recording the same "
    "team plan — that is expected. Four identical workbooks are not, and suggest one person "
    "talked while three wrote it down.",
    "THE CLOUDFORMATION IS NOT MARKED HERE. BSBXTW401 assesses teamwork and leadership; the "
    "technical write is its vehicle. Task 7 records where the student's contribution lives so it "
    "can be seen; its quality is ICTCLD504's business, in AT1 and AT3.",
    "THE OBSERVED MEETING IS NOT THE ONLY EVIDENCE, AND MUST NOT BE TREATED AS IT. BSBXTW401 does "
    "not tie coaching, issue resolution or conflict management to a meeting, and its assessment "
    "conditions require only a safe working or simulated environment. A well-run twenty-minute "
    "stand-up where nothing goes wrong gives a student nowhere to demonstrate [BSBXTW401 PC 3.4] "
    "or [BSBXTW401 PE 5]. Those criteria are carried by the written reflections in tasks 11–13; "
    "the observation confirms the student can hold a room. Do not fail a student for a quiet "
    "meeting.",
    "WHAT IS BEING MARKED. Each element carries two assessor-only lines: 'Evidences', naming the "
    "UoC items, and 'Satisfactory when', naming what has to be true for them to be met. Mark the "
    "second.",
    "This is an open-book assessment. Students may use the YAT intranet, course materials and "
    "external research (which must be cited). Collaboration within the team is the point; "
    "collaboration on the individual reflections is not.",
    "Reasonable adjustment may include scheduling the observed meeting at a time that suits the "
    "student, allowing the reflections to be given verbally and transcribed, or adjusting the "
    "team composition where a student's circumstances require it.",
    "Teacher/assessor support level: the assessor may clarify what a task is asking and may "
    "intervene where a team dynamic becomes genuinely harmful, but must not run the team's "
    "meetings, allocate its work, or resolve its conflicts for it.",
    "The assessment will not proceed if for any reason it is not safe to do so. You must advise "
    "the student of the reason for suspending the assessment, and what safety action should be "
    "taken. Advise the student of revised arrangements when it is safe to do so.",
    "There is a zero tolerance for plagiarism, cheating and collusion. Students will be expected "
    "to make a declaration that all work is their own prior to submission. Refer to the Training "
    "and Assessment Policy for further information.",

TASKS = [
    "YAT College has approved the improvement design for the Enrolline cloud infrastructure. The "
    "MTS improvement team implements it: four members, one cloud component each, one integrated "
    "deployable template.",
    "Part A — The planning meeting. Six tasks worked through with the team in the room, as an "
    "agenda: agree the common objectives, responsibilities and required outcomes; set each "
    "member's expected outcomes, measurable goals and agreed behaviours against YAT's code of "
    "conduct; agree accountability strategies; plan for contingencies including unplanned "
    "absence and re-allocation; allocate the four components with real instruction and a stated "
    "basis; and identify who outside the team the work depends on.",
    "Part B — The build. Two tasks recording where the student's own contribution lives and their "
    "part in integrating the four components, including what did not fit first time.",
    "Part C — Leading a meeting. The student leads one team meeting with the assessor observing, "
    "records it, and has the assessor complete the observation table at the end.",
    "Part D — What happened, and what you did. Three written reflections: a conflict or challenge "
    "the student dealt with, a time they coached or helped a team member, and an issue the team "
    "hit and their part in resolving it.",
    "Part E — Review and reflection. Measure each member including themselves against the plan, "
    "record the feedback given and when, identify development opportunities and what was actually "
    "done about them, and reflect on their own leadership.",
    "Three knowledge questions cover the organisational and legislative requirements that applied, "
