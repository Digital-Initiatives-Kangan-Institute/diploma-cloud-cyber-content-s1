"""The S1-CL3 AT3 implementation workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine in
the umbrella (`helpers/run_sheet.py`).

WHY THERE IS NO DEPLOYMENT REPORT TEMPLATE. ICTCLD504's assessment conditions (AC 1–8) are all
environment and input conditions and name no document format, so `[ICTCLD504 PC 4.1]` "Document
as-deployed architecture and test results" and `[ICTCLD504 PE 5]` "create documentation of
deployment and testing steps" are met by tasks 10 and 11 of this worksheet. The only unit in
this course requiring a separate document is ICTCLD501, via `[ICTCLD501 AC 3]`.

WHAT THE STUDENT IS DEPLOYING, AND WHOSE DESIGN IT IS. AT1 produced each student's own
improvement design and obtained sign-off for it. AT2 encoded an agreed design as infrastructure
as code, as a team. AT3 is individual again: the student deploys the baseline, applies the
approved improvement to it, and demonstrates it against the metrics AT1 set. An assessor
reference template is available as a fallback so that a team integration failure in AT2 cannot
block an individual's evidence here.

THE TESTS ARE THE ASSESSMENT. `[ICTCLD504 PC 3.3]` requires the student to test AND DEMONSTRATE
security, reliability, scalability and cost optimisation — all four. Tasks 5 to 8 are one per
concern, and each asks for a demonstration rather than an assertion: something was made to
happen, and something was observed. A student who says the design is reliable because it spans
two zones has not demonstrated anything; one who terminates an instance and shows the service
continuing has.

THE MARKING MODEL. Values here are ours, invented so the student has a concrete task. Each
element carries the `uoc` items it evidences and a `standard` naming what must be true for them
to be met. An assessor marks the standard, never the table. Because each student's approved
improvement differs, most standards here are about whether the demonstration actually tests the
thing the student themselves designed.
