"""The S1-CL3 AT1 improvement-design workbook — content, and the renderer that places it.

ONE definition, rendered two ways (student | assessor), through the shared workbook engine in
the umbrella (`helpers/run_sheet.py`).

WHY THERE IS NO SOLUTION DESIGN TEMPLATE. ICTCLD504's assessment conditions (AC 1–8) are all
environment and input conditions — a vendor, a managed database service, console/CLI tooling, an
IDE, requirements and standards, a browser, an SSH/RDP client. None names a document format or a
reporting standard, so `[ICTCLD504 PC 2.4]` "Document and present proposed architecture for
review to required personnel" is satisfied by this worksheet (the documenting) plus Part B (the
presenting). Same finding as ICTCLD503 and ICTCLD505; the only unit in this course that does
require a document is ICTCLD501, via `[ICTCLD501 AC 3]`.

THE IMPROVEMENT IS OPEN. This is the thing that separates CL3 from CL1's AT3. There is no
target architecture and no planted set of faults to find. The Improvement Requirements are
framed as outcomes — stable, reliable, fit for purpose, compliant — and IR-2 asks for sound
engineering proportionate to an internal, business-hours finance system, explicitly not
gold-plating. So a student who proposes every available improvement has not done better than one
who proposes three and justifies each; they have done worse, because IR-2 and IR-6 both ask for
justification against business need. The `standard` lines below are written to mark that.

STARTING STATE. Ledgerline sits at the single-AZ cloud baseline it reached during the migration:
one application instance in one availability zone, a single-AZ database, one NAT gateway. It
runs on Amazon Linux with a managed PostgreSQL database, and the vendor supports a
high-availability deployment with an automatic-failover standby — so database-tier resilience is
available to the student's design if they judge it warranted. Whether it IS warranted for an
internal business-hours system is exactly the proportionality judgement the cluster is testing.

THE MARKING MODEL. Values here are ours, invented so the student has a concrete task. Each
element carries the `uoc` items it evidences and a `standard` naming what must be true for them
to be met. An assessor marks the standard, never the table. Because the improvement is open,
most standards here are about the REASONING rather than the answer: a student who leaves the
database single-AZ and argues it against the recovery need and the cost has met the item, and so
has one who converts it and argues that.
