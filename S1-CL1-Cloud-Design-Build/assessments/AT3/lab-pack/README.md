# AT3 — Set up your baseline environment

Before you start the AT3 assessment you need to build the **starting environment** in AWS.
This guide walks you through it, step by step. You only do this once, at the start of AT3.

**What you are building:** a working (but not yet highly available) version of the YAT LMS
infrastructure — a web server behind a load balancer, with a database. During AT3 you will
improve this into a highly available design.

**You will need:**
- Your AWS Academy login.
- The file **`baseline.yaml`** (download it from your AT3 assessment page and save it somewhere
  easy to find, like your Downloads folder).
- About **20 minutes** (the environment takes ~15 minutes to build itself once you start it).

## Part 1 — Open the AWS sandbox

1. Log in to **AWS Academy** (the Canvas site your teacher gave you the link to).
2. On your **Dashboard**, click the tile named **AWS Academy Cloud Architecting**.
3. On the left-hand menu, click **Modules**.
4. Scroll down the page to the **Sandbox** heading, and click **Sandbox environment**.
5. A lab page opens. Near the top you will see a row with **Start Lab**, **End Lab**, and a
   small circle next to the word **AWS**. Click **Start Lab**.
6. Wait. The circle next to **AWS** turns **yellow** (starting), then **green** (ready). This
   takes a minute or two. **Wait for green.**
7. Click the green circle next to **AWS**. The **AWS Management Console** opens in a new browser
   tab. (If nothing opens, your browser may have blocked the pop-up — allow pop-ups for this
   site and click it again.)

You are now in the AWS console.

## Part 2 — Choose the correct region

8. Look at the **top-right** of the console. There is a region name there (it probably says
   *United States (N. Virginia)*).
9. Click it, and from the list choose **Asia Pacific (Sydney)**.

> ⚠️ Do this **before** the next part. Everything must be built in the Sydney region.

## Part 3 — Build the environment

10. In the **search bar** at the top, type **CloudFormation** and click it in the results.
11. Click the orange **Create stack** button (choose **With new resources** if it asks).
12. Under **Prepare template**, leave **Choose an existing template** selected.
13. Under **Template source**, choose **Upload a template file**.
14. Click **Choose file** and select the **`baseline.yaml`** file you saved earlier. Click **Next**.
15. On the next page:
    - **Stack name:** type `yat-lms-baseline`
    - Find the box labelled **DBMasterPassword** and type a password (at least 8 characters).
      **Write this password down** — it's the database admin password.
    - Leave every other box as it is.
    - Click **Next**.
16. On the **Configure stack options** page, don't change anything. Scroll to the bottom and
    click **Next**.
17. On the **Review** page, scroll to the bottom and click **Submit**.

The environment now starts building. You'll see a list of items turning from
**CREATE_IN_PROGRESS** (blue) to **CREATE_COMPLETE** (green).

18. **Wait about 15 minutes.** The database is the slowest part. When the stack name shows
    **CREATE_COMPLETE** (green) at the top, it's ready.

## Part 4 — Check it worked

19. Click the **Outputs** tab (near the top, next to Events/Resources).
20. Find the row **AlbDnsName** and copy its value (it looks like
    `yat-lms-dev-1234567890.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com`).
21. Open a new browser tab, type `http://` then paste that value, and press Enter.
22. You should see the text: **"Infrastructure ready - awaiting application deployment"**.
    (If it doesn't load straight away, wait 2–3 minutes and try again — the server takes a
    moment after building.)

If you see that page, your baseline environment is up and you're ready to begin AT3.

---

## Part 5 — When you finish (clean up)

Always do this at the end of your session so you don't waste your lab budget.

23. Go back to **CloudFormation**, click your **`yat-lms-baseline`** stack, and click **Delete**
    (confirm **Delete** when asked). Wait until it disappears from the list.
24. Go back to the lab tab and click **End Lab** at the top, then **Yes**.

## If something goes wrong

- **The stack says ROLLBACK or FAILED:** click the **Events** tab and look for the first red
  **CREATE_FAILED** row — its **Status reason** says what happened. Tell your teacher what it says.
- **The web page (Part 4) won't load:** give it a few more minutes; if it still won't load after
  ~10 minutes, delete the stack (Part 5) and start again from Part 3.
- **You ran out of time / the lab stopped:** you can click **Start Lab** again to get more time.
