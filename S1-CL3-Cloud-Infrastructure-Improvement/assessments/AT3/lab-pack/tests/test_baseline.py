"""Structural tests of the AT3 Enrolline lab-pack templates - run with NO AWS account.

Asserts the invariants that make this a valid existing-state baseline + a valid improvement
change-set, honouring the AWS Academy constraints and - critically - that the improvement actually
moves BOTH tiers to Multi-AZ: the baseline is single-AZ, the improved template is not.

Templates are parsed with cfn-lint's decoder so the intrinsic tags (!Ref, !GetAtt, !Sub, !Select,
!If, !GetAZs) load correctly.

Run from the lab-pack folder:  python -m pytest
