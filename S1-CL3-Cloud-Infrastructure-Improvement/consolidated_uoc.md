# S1-CL3 Cloud Infrastructure Improvement — Consolidated UoC

> **STATUS: DRAFT.** Every assessable item (PC / FS / PE / KE / AC) from the two cluster units, quoted **verbatim** from the validated UoC transcriptions and tagged `[UNIT SECTION numbering]`. Items are organised under a **topic** structure that follows the engagement workflow (analyse → design/approve → deploy/test → finalise), with a **technical strand** (ICTCLD504) and a **leadership strand** (BSBXTW401) per phase. **The group-level *assessment ideas* are proposals — marked TBD per CLAUDE.md Rule 1.** The cluster uses a **three-AT individual → group → individual** division (AT1 team setup / AT2 group analyse, design & approve / AT3 individual implementation); see the assessment plan for the full structure and coverage map.

**Cluster units**

| Unit | Title | Primary contribution |
|---|---|---|
| ICTCLD504 | Improve cloud-based infrastructure | The technical improve-cycle — analyse architecture, design improvements (security/reliability/scalability/cost), deploy/monitor/test, finalise |
| BSBXTW401 | Lead and facilitate a team | The leadership overlay — plan team outcomes, coordinate, support, monitor team performance |

**The integrated cluster:** *lead a team to improve a cloud system's infrastructure.* The 504 improvement project is the work; 401 is how the student (as team leader) runs it.

**Item inventory**

| Unit | PC | FS | PE | KE | AC | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ICTCLD504 | 18 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 8 | 46 |
| BSBXTW401 | 16 | 3 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 36 |
| **Total** | **34** | **8** | **10** | **20** | **10** | **82** |

**Reference-tag format.** `[<UNIT> <SECTION> <numbering>]` — e.g. `[ICTCLD504 PC 1.1]`, `[ICTCLD504 FS Reading]`, `[BSBXTW401 PE 2]`, `[ICTCLD504 KE 4]`, `[BSBXTW401 AC 1]`. PCs keep their source numbering; FS uses the verbatim skill name; PE/KE/AC are numbered `1..N` in source order. KE items with nested sub-bullets are quoted as one item (parent + children) under the parent's tag.

## Topic & assessment structure

The cluster organises into **four workflow phases**, each with a **technical group** (504) and a **leadership group** (401), plus cross-cutting foundation skills and assessment conditions. The same phases structure both teaching and assessment.

| Phase / Topic | Groups | Units | Assessment (AT — mode) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Analyse & Plan** | G1 (analyse architecture), G2 (plan team outcomes) | 504, 401 | **AT2** (G1 — individual analysis) + **AT1** (G2 — team plan) |
| **2. Design & Approve** | G3 (design/improve + present + sign-off), G4 (coordinate team) | 504, 401 | **AT2** (group) — G4 allocate also AT1 |
| **3. Deploy, Test & Support** | G5 (deploy/monitor/test), G6 (support team) | 504, 401 | **AT3** (individual, G5) + **AT2** (group, G6) |
| **4. Finalise & Review** | G7 (finalise improvements), G8 (monitor team performance) | 504, 401 | **AT3** (individual, G7) + **AT2** (group, G8) |
| **Cross-cutting** | G9 (foundation skills), G10 (environment & resource access), G11 (assessor requirements) | 504, 401 | both / environment / institutional |

**AT deliverables (three ATs — individual → group → individual; see the assessment plan §3):**
- **AT1 — Team Setup** *(individual; 401 el 1 + el 2 allocate)* — author the Team Plan: team objectives and responsibilities, per-member performance expectations, accountability strategies, contingency/risk planning, and the role & task allocation. No technical analysis or design — that is AT2.
- **AT2 — Analyse, Design & Approve** *(group; 504 el 1 + el 2 + 401 el 2–4)* — each student **individually analyses** the baseline (requirements & architecture analysis, incl. the compliance assessment), then the team **designs** the improved architecture (each owns one dimension, integrated), leads meetings, supports and reviews the team, and presents the **business case** for the **deploy sign-off** (`[ICTCLD504 PC 2.5]`).
- **AT3 — Implementation** *(individual; 504 el 3–4)* — each student deploys, monitors and tests their owned dimension against the metrics, refines, documents the as-deployed result + long-term strategy, and obtains **final sign-off** (`[ICTCLD504 PC 4.3]`).

**Two approval moments (UoC-faithful):** end of **AT2** = deploy sign-off (`[ICTCLD504 PC 2.5]`); end of **AT3** = final sign-off (`[ICTCLD504 PC 4.3]`).

**Vehicle (per `scenario-flow.md`):** **Ledgerline** (the Accounting system), single-AZ cloud — the system whose cloud infrastructure is improved. CL3 **assesses on Ledgerline**; the **website is the practice vehicle**. *`[ICTCLD504 KE 6]` (object storage for static web sites) is evidenced as a **contextual knowledge question** (AT2) — the student contrasts Ledgerline with an object-storage-dependent system (e.g. a website) and explains how they would provision that storage if needed.*

**Cross-cutting & delivery environment.** G9 (foundation skills) is co-evidenced inside both ATs' deliverables; G10 (environment & resource access) is provided by the scenario site + AWS Academy labs; G11 (assessor requirements) is the institutional assessor condition.

# Topic 1 — Analyse & Plan → AT2 (analyse, G1) + AT1 (plan team, G2)

Set up the team (AT1) and analyse the system (AT2) before designing changes.

## Group 1 — Analyse cloud architecture (ICTCLD504, element 1)

**Why grouped:** the opening of the improve-cycle — review the existing architecture, evaluate it and its business impact, weigh options against the business model, and set the improvement goals.

**Assessment:** an **individual** architecture analysis of the supplied baseline (Ledgerline's current single-AZ cloud infrastructure) — review, business-impact evaluation, the compliance assessment against the Indian Regulatory Requirements, options, and the security / reliability / scalability / cost goals + metrics. Authored individually within the group **AT2** so the holistic element-1 evidence (PC 1.1, PC 1.6) is valid per student; it feeds the team's design (G3).

# Cross-cutting (not a topic)

## Group 9 — Foundation skills

**Why grouped:** the language/literacy/employment skills essential to performance, co-evidenced inside both ATs' deliverables and interactions (the marking guides note where each is naturally evidenced rather than assessing it separately).

- **Get the work done** — Plans, organises and implements work activities in line with organisational policies and procedures [BSBXTW401 FS Get the work done]

## Group 10 — Assessment conditions: required environment & resource access

**Why grouped:** the Assessment Conditions "access to" requirements — the simulated/working environment, tooling and reference materials the assessment must provide. Provided by the scenario website + AWS Academy labs; defines the delivery environment rather than mapping to a marking criterion.

ICTCLD504:
- cloud vendor service provider [ICTCLD504 AC 1]
- cloud managed database service [ICTCLD504 AC 2]
- cloud management console, software development kit or command line tools [ICTCLD504 AC 3]

- internet and web browser [ICTCLD504 AC 6]
- secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) client to connect to cloud-hosted instances [ICTCLD504 AC 7]

BSBXTW401:
- A safe working or simulated environment [BSBXTW401 AC 1]

## Group 11 — Assessment conditions: assessor requirements

**Why grouped:** the identical trailing Assessment Conditions clause in each unit — assessor competency/qualification requirements. Institutional boilerplate, common to both units.

**Assessment idea (TBD):** satisfied by the institution's assessor-qualification policy; no AT artefact required.

- Assessors of this unit must satisfy the requirements for assessors in applicable vocational education and training legislation, frameworks and/or standards. [ICTCLD504 AC 8]
