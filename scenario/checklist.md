# S1-CL1 Scenario — Documents/Pages Checklist

> **STATUS: DRAFT.** Working checklist of every document, page, or artefact the cluster's mock scenario (YAT College) needs to publish so that students have a single reference source for the cluster assessments. Each item carries the UoC reference(s) it satisfies and the source status (already exists / needs port / needs new authoring). **Nothing here is decided** — list is for review and reaction.
>
> **Delivery vehicle (proposed, TBD):** mock YAT public website + mock intranet behind a fake SSO sign-in. Public site carries the org-facing content; intranet carries policies, procedures, ICT environment, project-engagement materials. Replaces handing students a bundle of separate documents.
>
> Status legend:
> - ✅ **Exists** in YAT case study (517 AT2 / 517 source) — port across
> - 🟢 **Portable from Llamazonia** (502 AT2) — rebrand-only port
> - 🟡 **Partial** — exists but thin / implicit, needs extension
> - ❌ **New authoring required**

## Intranet — Templates (downloadable blank templates for students to fill in)

Per Tim 2026-05-25: student-fillable templates live in `scenario/templates/`. These are the blank documents the YAT intranet exposes for download — distinct from the workspace-level institutional Word templates (which are gitignored).

- [-] **Business Case template** — ⏳ Empty placeholder file in place (`templates/template-business-case.md`). Referenced from AT1. Content TBD.
- [-] **Board Presentation Deck template** — ⏳ Placeholder file in place (`templates/template-business-case-pptx.md`). Referenced from AT1. Content TBD.
- [-] **Feedback Record template** — ⏳ Placeholder file in place (`templates/template-feedback-record.md`). Referenced from AT1 (and reused at the AT3 closure meeting). Content TBD.
- [-] **HA Design template (student-produced output, AT3)** — ⏳ Placeholder authored 2026-05-25 (`templates/template-ha-design-S1-CL1-AT3.md`). Mirrors the AT2 baseline design's shape but student-authored. AT3 Part A deliverable. Carries the bulk of 502's design-production PCs. Content TBD.
  - [ICTCLD502 PC 1.1, 2.1–2.5, 3.1–3.5] · [ICTCLD502 PE 1, PE 2]
- [-] **HA Deployment Report template (AT3 Part B)** — _Not yet authored as a separate file._ Per the simplified AT3 shape (locked in 2026-05-25), AT3 Part B reuses the same template structure as the AT2 Deployment Report (`template-deployment-report-S1-CL1-AT2.md`) — adapted for HA work. May or may not become a separate file at delivery time depending on how much HA-specific scaffolding is needed.
  - [ICTCLD502 PC 4.1–4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3] · [ICTCLD401 PC 4.3]
- [x] **Deployment Report template** — ✅ Authored 2026-05-25. Full template covering Cover / §1 Exec Summary / §2 Engagement Context / §3 Scope / §4 Build Narrative (4.1–4.8) / §5 Configuration Decisions (C1–C8 from supplied design) / §6 Testing & Validation / §7 Operational Handover / §8 Knowledge Evidence (Q1–Q6 covering 401 KE 5–10) / Appendix A — Build Evidence (17 named screenshots) / Appendix B — Configuration Exports / Appendix C — Test Evidence / Appendix D — Reflections (2 FS-evidencing prompts). UoC traceability map in authoring header. TBD for live delivery: confirm KE/reflection question wording, transfer to Word for student download. See `templates/template-deployment-report-S1-CL1-AT2.md`.
  - [ICTCLD401 KE 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (Knowledge Evidence appendix)
  - [ICTCLD401 FS Learning, Planning and organising, Self-management] (Reflections appendix)
  - Plus the PCs evidenced through the report body — see the authoring header's UoC traceability map

## Intranet — Document Archive (exemplars — nice-to-have, not assessment-critical)

Per Tim 2026-05-25: the YAT intranet hosts a Document Archive of past MTS deliverables so students learn that whenever they need to produce a business document they should look for prior examples to model from. Exemplars are a nice-to-have learning aid; assessments can run without them. To be authored as a batch, separately from assessment-task authoring.

- [-] **Example previous Business Case** — ⏳ Placeholder file in place (`exemplars/internal-document-exemplar-business-case.md`). Content TBD.
- [-] **Example previous Board Presentation Deck** — ⏳ Placeholder file in place (`exemplars/internal-presentation-exemplar-business-case.md`). Content TBD.
- [-] **Example previous Deployment Report** — ⏳ Scaffold authored 2026-05-25 (`exemplars/internal-document-exemplar-deployment-report.md`). Used as the reference exemplar for both AT2 and AT3 since AT3 reuses the same Deployment Report shape. Content TBD.

---

## Intranet — References (background reading)

- [x] **Industry standards reference list** — ✅ Authored 2026-05-23 (cloud definitions, security/privacy, architecture frameworks, operational management, web/data, network/identity, RTO-sector). See `internal-industry-standards-reference.md`.
  - [ICTCLD401 KE 1] industry technology standards used in cloud computing solutions and services
  - [ICTCLD502 KE 1] industry technology standards
  - [ICTCLD502 AC 5] industry standards
- [x] **Legislative requirements applicable to YAT (RTO context)** — ✅ Authored 2026-05-23 (privacy, RTO regulation, WHS, anti-discrimination, employment/financial, online safety, IP, critical infrastructure). See `internal-legislative-requirements-reference.md`.
  - [ICTCLD502 AC 5] legislative requirements
  - [ICTICT517 FS Navigate the world of work] following legislative requirements
- [x] **Reference architectures** — ✅ Authored 2026-05-23 (NIST cloud definitions, AWS Well-Architected, AWS CAF, multi-tier web app, multi-AZ RDS, IAM, migration "6 Rs", operational patterns). See `internal-reference-architectures.md`.
  - [ICTCLD401 KE 3] principles and functions of cloud computing solutions and technologies, including IaaS/PaaS/SaaS
  - [ICTCLD401 KE 11] functions, uses and differences of cloud models

## Assessor resources (assessor-only — operational delivery artefacts)

Files in `scenario/assessor-resources/` are **not** distributed to students via the YAT intranet. They are operational resources the assessor uses to deliver the cluster — set-up scripts, infrastructure templates, sample data files, etc.

- [-] **AT2 baseline CloudFormation template** — ⏳ Placeholder authored 2026-05-25 (`assessor-resources/at2-baseline-cloudformation.md`, will become `.yaml` when populated). CloudFormation template the assessor distributes to students at the start of the AT3 assessment day. Students deploy it in their AWS Academy lab to instantiate the AT2 baseline as a consistent AT3 starting state (regardless of what they personally built in AT2). Includes VPC + subnets + gateways + security groups + ASG + ALB + RDS single-AZ + S3 + monitoring baseline + user-data placeholder web page. Operational artefact — not direct UoC evidence. Content TBD.

---

## Cross-AT framing artefacts (not really documents, but worth noting)

- [x] **Mock SSO sign-in gate** — ✅ 2026-05-23 — folded into `website.md` §3 (visual / behaviour / copy / implementation specs). No separate document; it's a UX device described in the website spec rather than a content page.
- [x] **Cluster project narrative / front page** — ✅ Authored 2026-05-23 (two-layer page: upper half = public YAT homepage, lower half = MTS-consultant engagement framing for S1-CL1; cluster-specific framing in §4 will need revision per cluster). See `public-cluster-project-narrative.md`.

## Delivery vehicle (meta)

- [x] **Website specification** — ✅ Authored 2026-05-23 (`website.md`) — overall intent, site structure, SSO gate spec, state-versioning behaviour, hosting/build/SSG decisions (TBD). Meta-document for the team building the mock site; not part of the content set itself.

---

## Summary by status

Status of authoring as of 2026-05-23 (after the CBA cost data pack authoring pass — **all scenario content items complete**):

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| ✅ Authored / complete (content) | 27 |
| ❌ Still to author from scratch (content) | 0 |
| **Total content items** | **27 items** |
| Meta — website spec (`website.md`) | ✅ Authored separately |

**🎉 All scenario content items now drafted.** Many items carry inline **TBD** markers where Claude has invented specifics (names, headcounts, cost figures, retention periods, etc.) — these are flagged for Tim's review and confirmation before live delivery.

Next-phase work (separate from scenario authoring):
- Tim's review of the drafted scenario content + confirmation/adjustment of TBD items
- Stakeholder review (per `assessment_plan.md` §8 critical path)
- Build the actual mock website (per `website.md` — pick SSG, set up hosting, build pipeline)
- Author the cluster AT briefs themselves (referenced by the scenario but not part of it)
- Complete the assessment mapping document (official template) + transfer ATs to official templates (per `assessment_plan.md` §8 items 7–9)
